# Grading System

## The system is pending heavy-refactoring

## Entry

This is a fairly straight-forward system, that has two entry points.

* initial_download.sh [Run once]
* late_download.sh [Ran many times]

# Exit

* The only exit zips the folder, and runs the moss command.
* You can comment out the assignment of the moss command if you don't want to use moss.
